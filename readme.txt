briefly, this makes a random playlist but considers how
the songs will follow so it arranges them like a music
mixer will do!

it is a python script based on pydub and scipy.io.wavfile 
it reads a defined percentage from the start and the end of an audio
and arranges it depending on their arithmetic differences 
finally it makes a .m3u playlist that can be played by Vlc 

enjoy smart shuffled music :)
done with all the love in the world.
