briefly this makes a random playlist but considers how
they songs will follow so it arranges them like a music
mixer will do!

it is a python script based on pydub and scipy.io.wavfile 
it reads a define percentage from the start and the end of an audio
and arrange it depending on their arithmetic difference 
finally it makes a .m3u playlist that can be played by vlc 

enjoy lesser dumb shuffled music :)
done with all the love in the world.
